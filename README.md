## Overview

In 357 CE, Su Hui (蘇蕙) wove an impossible poem into silk brocade to win back her exiled husband. The result: a 29×29 grid of Chinese characters readable in any direction—horizontally, vertically, diagonally, spiraling, reversed—each path producing distinct rhyming poetry.

Her husband returned. The poem survived 1,700 years.

| Characters | 841 |
| Grid | 29 × 29 |
| Extractable poems | 7,958+ |

## The Border Poem

The outer ring forms a circular poem readable in both directions:

**Clockwise:**
> 仁智怀德圣虞唐，贞志笃终誓穹苍，钦所感想妄淫荒，心忧增慕怀惨伤
>
> *Benevolence and wisdom cherish virtue—sages Shun and Yao.*
> *Chaste will sincere to the end, swearing to the vault of heaven.*
> *Revering what I feel—vain, lustful, desolate.*
> *Heart's grief grows in yearning, cherishing miserable wounds.*

**Counter-clockwise:**
> 伤惨怀慕增忧心，荒淫妄想感所钦，苍穹誓终笃志贞，唐虞圣德怀智仁
>
> *Wounded and miserable, cherishing yearning, worry in my heart grows.*
> *Desolate licentiousness, vain thoughts—feeling what I revere.*
> *Vault of heaven, swearing to the end, sincere will.*
> *Yao and Shun—sage virtue cherishing wisdom and benevolence.*

## Translation Note: 唐 ≠ Tang Dynasty

The character **唐** (táng) does NOT refer to the Tang Dynasty (618–907 CE), which wouldn't exist for 260+ years after this poem was written.

**唐虞** refers to the legendary sage-emperors **Yao** (堯, ~2300 BCE) and **Shun** (舜, ~2200 BCE)—a classical phrase meaning "the golden age of virtuous rule."

The Tang Dynasty later took its name from this ancient association.

## What's Lost in Translation

| Element | Why it can't translate |
|---------|----------------------|
| Rhyme schemes | Based on Chinese phonology |
| Palindrome properties | Chinese grammar allows reversibility |
| Tonal musicality | Four tones create untranslatable melody |
| Character density | Each character = 1–5 English words |

This translation preserves meaning and structure. The music lives only in the original.
